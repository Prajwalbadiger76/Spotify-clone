#Project:Spotify-Clone from Scratch 

Iâ€™m excited to share my latest project where I rebuilt a Spotify-like web interface using just HTML and CSS! This journey was an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of web design principles and tackle real-world challenges.

ðŸ”¹ Utilized Font Awesome icons to closely replicate Spotifyâ€™s original design.

ðŸ”¹ Implemented sticky navigation bars and leveraged Flexbox for responsive layout management.
ðŸ”¹ Mastered the CSS Box Model for precise element alignment and spacing.
ðŸ”¹ Resolved various implementation errors and optimized the design for a seamless user experience.

This project has been a fantastic learning experience and has significantly enhanced my front-end development skills. Looking forward to applying these skills to future projects!
